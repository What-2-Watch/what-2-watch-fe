## About the Project

In this capstone project, our team was asked to create a full-stack app of our choosing and push ourselves by implementing a new technology. The back-end team chose to learn Python, while our front-end team decided to use the framework Vue. By the end of the project, both teams successfully understood and applied both technologies to the project

## Project Learning Goals
1. Demonstrate knowledge youâ€™ve gained throughout Turing
2. Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
3. Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
4. Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
5. Practice an advanced, professional git workflow using Git Rebase
6. Gain experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features
7. Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
8. Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec

## Challenges
1. Building an app with Vue(new to frontend team).
2. Learning and following a Git Rebase workflow.
3. Working hand in hand with a backend team to meet sprint deadlines for the first time.
4. Evolving project MVP, and intial documentation. The look and essential functionality of the app were everchanging throughout the project.
5. Realizing that we had neglected to fully understand the structure and common practices of Vue apps up front, and consequently changing our app's structure from the ground up.
## Wins
1. Built a sharp and professional app with the help of our backend team.
2. Despite the major Vue restructuring and countless documentation changes, we were able to push through and create an app that we are all proud of
